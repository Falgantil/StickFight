StickFight is a Windows Console based game.

StickFight matches the player against the computer, or another player on the same keyboard.

Yep, two players on the same system. Pretty retro.

Why?
====
**I guess this is the most relevant question, isn't it?**

This is a result of being WAY ahead in school, and asking a random friends for an idea on some random programming project.

A couple of years back, I started this as a result of being way ahead in class, and a playable beta version was ready after a couple of days. I've slighting improved on the code over the years, whenever I've felt like it.

*Note that this is years back, before I became as "good" as I am now.*

Version
----

1.4 (Honestly, no clue. But I've done approximately 4 "large" edits since the initial finish).

*(Runs ASP.Net, so might take some time for the initial load)*

-----------

Tech
-----------

Tech used for development is as following:

* C#: Language used for coding the entire game.
* Visual Studio: IDE used for coding the entire game.

No frameworks was used for the development of this. I made this before I was actually aware that there existed frameworks for C#.
